# Docker-Based-Shop-Management

This was a school project for E-business Inftastructure course. 

The following tasks were accomplished in this project:
* Implementation of web services that constitute the system.
* Deployment of the system using container orchestration tools.  

The system was designed to support multi-user operation, and it was carefully planned to ensure efficient performance. While some functionality was publicly accessible, certain features were exclusively available to logged-in users. The Python programming language and Flask SQLAlchemy library were utilized to process user requests, with SQL queries implemented wherever possible for efficient processing. Along with the code, Docker Image templates representing various components of the system were included to enable the appropriate containers' launch. In addition to implementation, configuration files required to execute the entire system on a cluster of computers were developed.
